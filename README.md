## The Problem

In Lagos' informal skilled-trades market, one question often stands between an employer and an artisan:

> **"Can I trust this person to actually do the job?"**

Hiring often depends on word-of-mouth, personal recommendations, or unverified claims of experience.

At the same time, skilled workers face the opposite problem:

> **"How do I prove that I'm actually good at what I do?"**

Verivo is built to solve both sides of that problem.

---

## What is Verivo?

**Verivo** is a platform where informal skilled workers can prove their expertise through a diagnostic verification process involving:

- 🧠 **Knowledge assessment**
- 🎙️ **Voice-based AI interaction**
- 🛠️ **Proof of work**
- 📊 **Iṣẹ́ Score**
- 🪪 **Portable, replayable credentials**

Employers can then discover verified workers, compare their credentials and Iṣẹ́ Scores, post jobs, and hire with greater confidence.

Payments are protected through **per-job escrow**, helping reduce payment risk for both sides.

> **Verivo turns trust from something you assume into something you can verify.**

## 🧠 AI-Powered Verification

Verivo uses **RAG + Gemini** to make skill verification more meaningful than a generic AI conversation.

A worker's trade-specific knowledge is grounded against a curated knowledge base.

```text
Knowledge Base
      │
      ▼
   Embeddings
      │
      ▼
   Pinecone
      │

      ▼

      ▼
Retrieve relevant context
      │
      ▼
    Gemini
      │
      ▼
Next Question / Assessment
```

Instead of simply asking:

> "Are you good at repairing phones?"

Verivo can evaluate whether a worker **actually understands the trade** through contextual diagnostic questions.

---

## 📊 Iṣẹ́ Score

The **Iṣẹ́ Score** is Verivo's core trust signal.

It combines:

**Knowledge** — how well the worker performs during verification.

**Trust** — what the worker demonstrates through completed jobs and work history.

The weighting can evolve as a worker builds experience:

```text
New Worker
    │
    ├── Knowledge carries more weight
    │
    ▼
First Jobs
    │
    ├── Real-world performance begins contributing
    │
    ▼
Completed Jobs
    │
    ├── Trust becomes increasingly important
    │
    ▼
Established Worker
    │
    └── Strong verified reputation
```

This means a new worker can prove their ability without already having years of platform history, while experienced workers can build a stronger reputation through successful jobs.

---

## 💰 Escrow Payments

Trust shouldn't stop at hiring.

Verivo uses job-based escrow to protect the payment process.

```text
EMPLOYER
   │
   │ Fund job
   ▼
┌──────────────┐
│    ESCROW    │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       │ Worker completes job
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   CONFIRM    │
│  COMPLETION  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   RELEASE    │
│   PAYMENT    │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
    WORKER
```

Workers get confidence that funded jobs have money secured.

Employers get confidence that funds are released according to the agreed completion flow.
